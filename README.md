# YosoraLife

Hello, I’m Remco. I’m a self-taught web developer and technology enthusiast with a lifelong passion for motorcycles.

I have been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, an autism disorder. Although this can bring challenges, I prefer to focus on the positive aspects of life. I try to live life to the fullest the way I want to. And hopefully with this blog I can inspire other people to do the same.
